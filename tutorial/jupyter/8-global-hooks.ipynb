    "When expanding the synthetic network, there may be some criterion which, when met, causes the expansion to cease.  One of these may be that a certain maximum number of molecules is reached (possibly for memory reasons).  Another may be that a target molecule has been produced.  In each of these scenarios, a global hook function can provide the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, a hook function is added to one strategy which sets a total molecule threshold at 10.  When this threshold is exceeded, the network will not be expanded by further iterations.  This strategy is compared to one without the global hook function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Global hooks can also be used in order to refresh/update metadata in order to reconcile conflicts that may have accumulated.  For example, in the mass waste example above there may be a lower mass waste calculated for a molecule which was previously generated and assigned a mass waste.  Therefore, molecule produced from that one must have their metadata updated.  A global hook function is useful for such an update.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚧UNDER CONSTRUCTION🚧\n",
    "\n",
    "There are not currently any global hook functions providing such a functionality.  However, the implementation is relatively simple and looking over the examples in [hooks.py](../../pickaxe_generic/hooks.py) should provide some suggestions as to how these may be implemented.  In addition, the interface that global hooks subclass from (located in [interfaces.py](../../pickaxe_generic/interfaces.py)) contains a docstring for the `__call__` method which describes the meaning of the different `Enum` return types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addendum: Global Hook Functions and the Cartesian Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be of some interest that the Cartesian strategy is actually the same as the [priority queue](./9-priority-queue.ipynb) strategy.  It accomplishes this by adding a default global hook which limits the number of iterations, as well as defining both the heap size and beam size as uncapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that the Cartesian strategy can run out of RAM if the number of possible recipes in a particular generation becomes too large.  If a higher-memory solution is desired, a method involving recipe filtering and generation metadata may be used with limited beam/heap sizes in order to guarantee a replication of the Cartesian strategy with a lower memory requirement.  However this has not been implemented as of the present time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Between iterations, a sequence of global hook functions will execute which provide the user a way to intervene in the network expansion in order to reconcile metadata, pause the expansion, limit the expansion based on certain global conditions, or any other functionality which is required.\n",
    "1. Global hook functions are fairly straightforward to implement, requiring only a single function implementation.\n",
    "1. The Cartesian strategy is a thin layer over the Priority Queue strategy, and uses its own global function to limit the number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations!  You have finished the eighth part of the Pickaxe-Generic tutorial.  Proceed to the [next part](./9-priority-queue.ipynb) to learn how the advanced Priority Queue strategy works and use it to implement a number of network search algorithms.\n"
